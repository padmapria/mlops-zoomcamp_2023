We have to use python 3.9 for this lesson,
conda create --name <env name> python==3.9
Q1. Just followed the insturctions and created the main function
python batch.py 2022 4

Q2 and Q3. For unit test create a test folder and create init.py file and a file to perform unit test in the test folder

Q4. Create a docker-compose to start the liveserver
docker-compose up

run the bat file to create a bucker
create_bucket.bat

create a new file batch_reconfigured.py, which uses liveserver s3 file as input and predicts over the file(No need to run the file at this step, as no input file is in s3 at this step, we will call this python file for Q6)

Q5.create a py file in the test folder to perform integration test.  Use the dummy dataframe we created in unittest Q3 step, store the dataframe as input file to liveserver s3, check the size of the file stored in s3, by calling the function "get_file_size"

Q6. Read the input file from s3 (the file we created in previous step) run the prediction over the data by calling  batch_reconfigured.py, save the output file to s3, by calling the function
 save_data(year, month)
