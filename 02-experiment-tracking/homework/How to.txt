These scripts have to be executed sequentially in the given order. Each script performs a specific task in ML workflow, such as data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and model registration. By running these scripts in sequence, you can preprocess the data, optimize the model's hyperparameters, and register the best model for future predictions/to pass to production environment.

1)install the needed libraries
pip install -r requirement.txt

2) preprocess the input data
python preprocess_data.py --raw_data_path data --dest_path ./output

3)Train a model with autolog
python train.py

4) Launch the tracking server locally for MLflow
start the mlflow ui from a new terminal using the below code(we store all the mlflow metadta and artifacts in mlflow.db)

cd to homework folder from a new terminal
https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-ui
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlflow-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0

5) Tune model hyperparameters using Optuna and MLflow
python hpo.py

6) Promote the best model to the MLFlow model registry
python register_model.py

Things to note
------------------
Autolog makes the logging process easy, it logs all the params,
